<p>
	Although The United States does not reconize taiwan as a nation nor does it
	it reconize that China owns Taiwan, and would protect the island from China
	if invasion where to happen. And only 14 Nations out of the 193 nations in
	the UN reconize Taiwan as a nation, one to name is Guatemala.
	Somwhere around May of 2021 President Xi Did Announce that is will invade
	Taiwan some time soon, It could be in decade, and if so Taiwan is Prepared
	for a Chinese invasion. And when it happens it would give China a bad look
	so far China has Violeted its Citizens. and has very horrible Human Rights.
	not only that its democracy index it ranks far last. and China Invading a 
	pro Democracy anti Communist Island would make the world see what china is
	doing. and that is expanding its sphear of communist Influeance around 
	south east Asia.
